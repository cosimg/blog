From September 2 to September 4 the 2023 NATO Wargaming Inititaive took place at the Helmut-Schmidt-Universit√§t Hamburg in connection with the (Aus)Bildungskongress der Bundeswehr, the German Armed Forces' main conference on professional military education. Large numbers of wargames were run, and CoSimG got the opportunity not only to settle some internal scores dating back to last year's conference in Rome, but also to showcase the Tschischwitz Kriegsspiel.

Instead of a descriptive text, there is a short video that was taken during the game:

In the end, the blue side prevailed over the red side; even in a fairly short timeslot the Kriegsspiel generated a considerable amount of fog-of-war, giving participants some impression of the capability of the instrument.
