**Introduction.**

Many researching the history of the *Kriegsspiel* will probably have made similar experiences when encountering original 19th c. rules for the first time: a general puzzlement about how it all might have worked will have resulted in vague doubts about general accessibility setting in. This is very understandable and due to the general nature of these rulesets; after all, they were designed to be aids for facilitators who did not require much information about the general setup or running of a *Kriegsspiel*. Thus, rulesets usually provide only mechanisms for moving and fighting units and offer very little if any practical advice on how to set up and run a *Kriegsspiel*.

The purpose of these brief notes is therefore to provide some guidance for anyone trying to run a *Kriegsspiel* game. While they were written with the Conflict Simulation Group's "Sussex Sorrows" in mind (for more information see the description on [this page](https://cosimg.github.io/2019/11/02/classroom-simulations.html), they are in principle applicable to any kind of Kriegsspiel game. There is one important qualification: Kriegsspiele run by the Conflict Simulation Group are primarily run in educational contexts, and this educational approach is responsible for some of what is written below. To take but one example. if the main aim of the *Kriegsspiel* is not to educate but to entertain, running it in real time may not be as important as it is for educational purposes.

**General Preparation.**

One of the significant advantages of *Kriegsspiel*-type wargaming is that logistical requirements are minimal.  Normally, one would divide participants into two teams red and blue which then form one or several staff teams depending on their respective size, and ideally have a room for each staff team. However, just having separate tables is fine as well if there is some sort of divider shielding the facilitators' map from the participants.

Some effort, however, is required for the scenario design. Participants have to be provided with a general scenario overview, specific missions and order of battle sheets. Ideally, facilitators should also hand out sundry pieces of intelligence and information which add some colourful detail to the scenario. While not absolutely necessary for running a Kriegsspiel-type wargame, including such elements has shown to considerably increase immersion, which in turn results in a deeper experience for the participants. Example would be the inclusion of role-playing elements like biographical details for subordinate commanders as sketched out in the "Useful Idiots and Insufferable Geniuses" supplement to the "Sussex Sorrows" rules, or fictitious newspaper clipping commenting on events related to the scenario. The information pack should also include a copy of the map used by the facilitators; while it could be done in theory without, having the same points of reference on the map offers practical advantages for both participants and facilitators – unless not having these advantages is actually part of the *Kriegsspiel*, of course!
