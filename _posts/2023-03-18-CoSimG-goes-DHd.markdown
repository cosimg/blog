The briefest of blog entries today: On March 18, it was all hands to the pump for the Conflict Simulation Group, as PIa Hennig, Steffen Pielström and Jorit Wintjes attended the [DHd2023 Open Humanities Open Culture conference](https://dhd2023.dig-hum.de/) jointly organized by the universities of Luxembourg and Trier. 

Pia Henning presented a poster showcasing her current research on the Prussian Kriegsspiel rules of the 1824 to 1918 period, while Steffen Pielström and Jorit Wintjes gave an overview over the Conflict Simulation Group's use of conflict simulations and wargames in history and digital humanities courses; that poster can be found below (the poster is in German).
